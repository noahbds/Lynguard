Lil7 Games — README

Overview
- 2D LibGDX game using Ashley ECS, Tiled maps, and a MVVM UI layer.
- Core loop managed by `GameScreen`, with systems for player, enemies, rendering, camera, hazards, transitions, and HUD.

Requirements
- Java: `JDK 17` (recommended; 11+ may work).
- Build: `Gradle` (wrapper preferred) or `Maven` if project provides a pom.
- Libraries (bundled via build tool):
	- LibGDX (graphics, input, audio)
	- Ashley (ECS)
	- Tiled/TMX support
	- Scene2D UI

Project Structure (core highlights)
- `asset/`: Asset types and `AssetService` (atlas, map, skin, sound, music).
- `audio/`: `AudioService` for SFX/BGM and listener position.
- `component/`: ECS components (data only): `Transform`, `Physics`, `Velocity`, `Collider`, `Player`, `Enemy`, `Life`, `Animation2D`, etc.
- `system/`: ECS systems (logic): `PlayerSystem`, `EnemySystem`, `RenderSystem`, `CameraSystem`, `HazardSystem`, `LevelTransitionSystem`, `AnimatedTileSystem`, `InvulnerableSystem`, `InteractionSystem`, `DyingSystem`, `LifeSystem`, `DamagedSystem`, `NoGravityHudSystem`.
- `tiled/`: `TiledService` and `TiledAshleyConfigurator` for map loading and entity setup.
- `ui/model/` & `ui/view/`: MVVM HUD and menu views (`HudViewModel`, `HudView`, etc.).
- `screen/`: Screens for menu/loading/pause/save/death.
- `GameScreen.java`: Main gameplay orchestration.
- `Lynguard.java`: Game bootstrap and shared services.

Installation
1) Clone the repository.
2) Ensure JDK 17 is active.
3) If using Gradle wrapper, build once to fetch dependencies.

fish shell examples:
```fish
set -l JAVA_HOME (status --is-interactive; and echo $JAVA_HOME); or echo "Ensure JDK 17 installed"
./gradlew tasks
./gradlew build
```

Running
- Desktop run via Gradle (LibGDX launcher entrypoint).
```fish
./gradlew run
```
- If a specific desktop launcher class is configured (e.g., `DesktopLauncher`), Gradle `application` plugin will use it automatically.

Usage
- Controls (from `GameScreen`):
	- `ESC` opens pause screen.
	- `C` toggles No-Gravity effect with cooldown.
- Gameplay:
	- Player spawns from Tiled map spawn layer.
	- Enemies spawned from `SLIMES` layer, patrolling within contiguous tiles.
	- Auto-save every 60 seconds via `MenuViewModel#autoSave()`.
	- Death transitions to `DeathScreen` after `DyingSystem` removes the entity.

Save/Load
- `SaveData` persists: level name, player position, life/max life, keys, and dead enemies per level.
- Load by calling `GameScreen#setSaveData(...)` before `show()` or via menu auto-load.

Deployment
- Desktop packaging (Gradle):
```fish
./gradlew distZip
./gradlew distTar
```
- Artifacts under `build/distributions/` include start scripts for Linux/macOS/Windows.
- For platform-specific bundles (e.g., LWJGL natives), ensure dependencies are correctly configured in Gradle.

Development Notes
- ECS separation: components are data-only; systems implement behavior.
- Services are injected into systems/screens (`AssetService`, `AudioService`, `TiledService`).
- UI follows MVVM: `View` subclasses bind to `ViewModel` properties.
- Keep `GameScreen` orchestration light; push entity-specific logic to systems.

Troubleshooting
- Black screen or missing textures → verify atlases loaded via `AssetService.load(...)` and region names.
- Spawn issues → check Tiled layers: `PLAYER_SPAWN`, `SLIMES`, map properties (e.g., `player_spawn_<level>`).
- Audio position not updating → ensure `Transform` present and `AudioService.updateListenerPosition(...)` called.
